					<h2>About Me</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					Hi, I'm Evan Mao and welcome to my website! I am a Chinese-Canadian, born in Alberta, Canada, before
					moving to America in 2021,
					where I am currently living in Redmond, Washington. I am studying computer science student at the
					University of Washington in Seattle. I have a strong passion in
					problem solving, tackling new problems, and continuing to learn new things about technology in the
					field.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am also part of the UW Husky Marching Band and Wind Ensemble, playing trombone and collaborating
					with many other
					musicians like me to perform in front of thousands of people. I also used to be a competitive
					pianist, winning many
					gold medals in state competitions. I still practice piano occasionally.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some other hobbies I have include skiing, video games, admiring cool cars, meeting new people, and
					playing Catan!
				</p>

				<h3>Custom Length Wordle</h3>
				<div class="separator"></div>
				<div>
					<img class="image project" alt="my wordle bot played on the console of VS code" id="wordle-demo"
						src="./assets/css/images/wordle_demo.png" />
				</div>
				<p>
					This <a href="https://github.com/officialblooms/Wordle">Wordle program</a> is a Java project I
					started in High School that I continue to refine as I learn
					more about programming in university!
					It prompts the user to guess a word of desired length (from 3 to 6 letters) and gives feedback on
					the correctness of the guess, like the real Wordle,
					except more flexible! This program also features hard mode as well! I'm currently working on
					implementing it into its own website so that it can be played online!
				</p>
				<h3>"Chopin Liszt" Discord Bot</h3>
				<div class="separator"></div>
				<div>
					<img class="image project" alt="my discord bot in action" id="discord-bot"
						src="./assets/css/images/discord_bot.jpg" />
				</div>
				<p>
					Chopin Liszt (sounds very similar to "shopping list") is a passion project to practice coding in
					Python, and also further educate myself on topics
					I am passionate about: Classical Music, and the Beatles! The bot includes features such as picking
					out a random song from a user-specificied Spotify
					playlist, posting random supercars alongside information about them from Google Gemini, and a daily
					message that includes history of a random Beatles
					and classical song! <br>
					<b>FULL DISCLAIMER:</b> I haven't actually gotten into deploying the bot for users to test, so you
					can't actually use it at the moment. I'm currently working
					on making it happen, as well as implementing more features and commands to make the bot more
					interactive and enjoyable for users with similar interests as me!
				</p>
				<h3>My Youtube Channel</h3>
				<div class="separator"></div>
				<div class="image project">
					<img class="image project" alt="front page of my youtube channel (sorted by most popular)"
						id="youtube-channel" src="./assets/css/images/youtube.png" />
				</div>
				<p>
					I have a Youtube channel where I post all sorts of things related to my hobbies. I have a
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YY6IzhKMrg0">Geometry Dash video</a> with over 2.2 million
					views, a
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVx8YoSzhE0&t=902s">three-year music transcription
						project</a>
					on one of the "games" on the Nintendo Wii, and recently, I spent over three days making a
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xa4LNzJES0&t=839s">Minecraft video</a>
					showcasing a relaxing parkour course with giant mob builds and beautiful scenery!
				</p>
				<h3>My Twitch Channel</h3>

				</iframe>
				<p>
					I used to be a live streamer on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialblooms">Twitch</a>, where I
					would
					stream games very frequently and talk
					with my viewers, new or returning, about many
					different things, and just having a great time! Unfortunately, due to college, I haven't had the
					chance to
					stream, but I hope to get back into it soon!
					Above is a video of an event I hosted on the popular video game Minecraft, where my viewers would
					fight each other and win prizes. It was a super fun event!
