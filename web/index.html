            <div id="bio">Hi! I'm Evan Mao. I'm a student at University of Washington studing computer science.
                I currently reside in Redmond, Washington but was originally from Canada (eh!).
                <br>
                My interests and passions include programming, playing classical music on piano and trombone,
                and playing Geometry Dash and Minecraft in my free time! I also enjoying socializing with
                friends, meeting new people, and keen to learn new things!
                <br>

            <p>Below are some fun projects related to my passions I have worked on!

                    This Wordle program is a Java project I started in High School that I continue to refine as I
                    learn more about programming in university!
                    It prompts the user to guess a word of desired length (from 3 to 6 letters) and gives
                    feedback on the correctness of the guess, like
                    the real Wordle, except more flexible! This program also features hard mode as well! I'm
                    currently working on implementing it into
                    its own website so that it can be played online!

                <div id="chopin-liszt-text">
                    Chopin Liszt (sounds very similar to "shopping list") is a passion project to practice coding in
                    Python, and also further educate myself
                    on topics I am passionate about: Classical Music, and the Beatles! The bot includes features
                    such as picking out a random song from a
                    user-specificied Spotify playlist, posting random supercars alongside information about them
                    from Google Gemini, and a daily message
                    that includes history of a random Beatles and classical song! I'm currently working on
                    implementing more features and commands to make
                    the bot more interactive and enjoyable for users with similar interests as me!

                <div id="twitch-channel-text"> I started streaming regularly on Twitch in 2020, gaining over 3,000
                    followers online through my
                    friendly interactions and entertainment with
                    viewers. On my 2+ hour livestreams, I played games like Minecraft, Geometry Dash, or other games
                    that I and my fans enjoy. I often hosted
                    special events where viewers would compete for prizes, or where for every $5 donated I would
                    spin a wheel that would determine a random, pretty
                    embarrassing thing I would have to do on stream in front of often 20-30 concurrent viewers. I'm
                    currently on a hiatus from streaming due to
                    university, but I plan on returning to it soon!

            <p>I am a member of the Husky Marching Band in my university, and in 2023 our football team went to the
                PAC-12 Football
                Championship in Las Vegas, Nevada! It was an intense game, but we came through with the win! Here is

            <p>
                Back in my senior year, I had the opportunity to conduct the last piece for my school's Wind
                Ensemble
                concert! I worked with my bandmates to prepare the piece, and share my musical knowledge with them
                to
                perform in front
                of 300+ people. It was a great experience and I enjoyed every moment of it! Here is a

            <p>
                Back in 2022, I won a local piano competition and performed Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto
                with
                the Mukilteo Community
                Orchestra at a live concert attended by over 200 people! I collaborated with the conductor, Shaun
                Day,
                to ensure the performance
                would be spectacular. Click <a href="https://youtu.be/VY6jcFF3nAo?si=t3spjPsYvHEP4MEJ">here</a> to

            <h2>Forza Horizon 5 Gallery</h2>
            <p>I love cars, and I love photographing them as well! Unfortunately I do not own a $1+ million supercar
                and
                have no plans to
                buy one anytime soon, but I do have lots in Forza Horizon 5! Here are some of my favorite cars I
                have
                taken photos of in the game!
